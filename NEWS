Changes in version 1.20.1:

New command-line options '+line', '+/RE', and '+?RE' have been implemented to
set the current line to the line number specified or to the first or last line
matching the regular expression 'RE'.
(Suggested by Matthew Polk and John Cowan).

File names containing control characters 1 to 31 are now rejected unless they
are allowed with the command-line option '--unsafe-names'.

File names containing control characters 1 to 31 are now printed using octal
escape sequences.

Ed now rejects file names ending with a slash.

Intervening commands that don't set the modified flag no longer make a second
'e' or 'q' command fail with a 'buffer modified' warning.

Tilde expansion is now performed on file names supplied to commands; if a file
name starts with '~/', the tilde (~) is expanded to the contents of the
variable HOME. (Suggested by John Cowan).

Ed now warns the first time that a command modifies a buffer loaded from a
read-only file. (Suggested by Dan Jacobson).

It has been documented that 'e' creates an empty buffer if file does not exist.

It has been documented that 'f' sets the default filename, whether or not its
argument names an existing file.

The description of the exit status has been improved in '--help' and in the
manual.

The variable MAKEINFO has been added to configure and Makefile.in.

It has been documented in INSTALL that when choosing a C standard, the POSIX
features need to be enabled explicitly:
  ./configure CFLAGS+='--std=c99 -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=2'
