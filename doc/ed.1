.SH NAME
ed \- line-oriented text editor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ed
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,file\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
GNU ed is a line\-oriented text editor. It is used to create, display,
modify and otherwise manipulate text files, both interactively and via
shell scripts. A restricted version of ed, red, can only edit files in
the current directory and cannot execute shell commands. Ed is the
\&'standard' text editor in the sense that it is the original editor for
Unix, and thus widely available. For most purposes, however, it is
superseded by full\-screen editors such as GNU Emacs or GNU Moe.
